## Description

Using the stylesheet and index.html, providing html comments and following all semantics. This project was built for proof of knowledge on how to condense and clean up existing code, dictate semantic comments, and solve issues with non-existent url connections. I learned how to connect href links, the differences between elements and classes, and the in depth meaning of cascading in CSS.
